  "notes": "Dieters parents were tradespeople in small halfing settlement, he was the youngest sibling of 4, but on the day of his birth the town was raided and his 3 older siblings were slain right in front of him. As they drew their last breaths Dieter could see apparitions of them detaching from their bodies. After that he grew up to be a loner in school, and when he finally dropped out he fell in with a bad crowd. After a while a gang boss offered him a job, to destroy the reputation of an opposing gangs leader, the pay was good so he accepted. He didn't feel any regret or guilt. In the ensuing gang war he was hired time and time again to do different things - stealing, killing, and negative PR were his best trade. After the dust had settled a bit, he found the woman of his dreams and finally settled down, but it didn't hold for long as his deeds in the gang war came to haunt him. They killed his then wife, again in front of him...but then he noticed something weird, he again saw an apparition detach from her body, but this time he knew what it was: her soul! After a time of anguish he hardened his resolve and went out adventuring, to try and find the souls of his lost ones...",

This leaves your mind permanently marked.\n\nCompletion Benefit:\nAny sane creature that attempts to read your thoughts takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage (Will DC 10 + 1/2 your level + your Charisma modified negates).
